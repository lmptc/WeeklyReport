# Ming Lian - Week of 04/12/2021

## 1. At least 2 of the 3 subsections should have material

### 1.1 Papers Read


### 1.2 Code Written

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ahycMe76lk7eXEaxjvrhtY6_0SkOKynz?usp=sharing: 

Tried the ways to organize the files, prepare for the next step. 

### 1.3 Other (algorithm, discussion with experts, went to conference)
https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.rec.html#structured-datatypes

The manual of structured arrays of python.

https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/fits/

Introduce the .fits data that is commonly used in astronomy. 

## 2. Figures (at least 1 figure)

Figure 1: The sizes of the head files for different events.

Figure 2: The sizes of the photometry files for different events. 

### 3 Results (required)

Tried the ways for organizing the folders and data, which is necessary for making the statistics.

### 4 Planning (required)

If I get information from Professor Narayan about how to understand the data, I will make statistics for the data, like how many curves are there for each event and 
how many data points in the curves. 

If I don't get further information, I will look into the data files and try to look for any useful information and make graphs for that.
