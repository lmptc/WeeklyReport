## 1. Papers and code

### 1.1 Papers Read

[Presto-Color: A Photometric Survey Cadence for Explosive Physics and Fast Transients](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1538-3873/ab121a): 
In order to characterize the properties of fast transients and transient properties, both the magnitude and the color of 
the object need to be determined. The paper proposes the criteria of the cadence that can fulfill the required scientific purposes, 
and provides the method to evaluate the resutls. 

### 1.2 Code Written

[Evaluate Aliasing](https://github.com/lmptc/MAF/blob/master/Evaluate%20Aliasing.ipynb): 
Measure the aliasing produced by a group of measurement when a frequency is provided.

## 2. Figures

Figure 1 : The aliasing results of the first year of presto_10yrs.db, with the frequency set to 3/day and 4/day.

### 3 Results

Created the metric for measuring aliasing, which is waiting improvement to realise further purposes. Read the Presto-Color paper, 
on the way to make required metrics.
