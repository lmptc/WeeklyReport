#### The Diverse Science Return from a Wide-Area Survey of the Galactic Plane

Although the glactic plane is often avoided in previous observations due to the high density of the stars, 
this paper suggests that a lot science can be got by observing the area, and the Magellanic Clouds. The paper introduces the objects 
that can be benefited, and the respective requirement for observing strategies. It also gives the ways to evaluate the performance of the 
strategies, and the alert criterium for the objects that need follow-up observations. Most of these can be achieved by existing Metrics. 

### 1.2 Other 

Read the MAF tutorialsï¼š

Introduction Notebook.ipynb (https://github.com/LSST-nonproject/sims_maf_contrib/blob/master/tutorials/Introduction%20Notebook.ipynb) 

and Writing A New Metric.ipynb (https://github.com/LSST-nonproject/sims_maf_contrib/blob/master/tutorials/Writing%20A%20New%20Metric.ipynb).



## 2. Figures (at least 1 figure)

Figure 1 : No figure produced yet.

### 3 Results (required)

I have went through the basic knowledge of Python and about how to create new Metrics. I am now ready to write some code and 
will go on to read the white papers.
