# Ming Lian - Week of 04/05/2021

## 1. At least 2 of the 3 subsections should have material

### 1.1 Papers Read

[Presto-Color: A Photometric Survey Cadence for Explosive Physics and Fast Transients](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03146): 
The paper suggested a minimal survey strategy that is required for deciding the light curve and the color of an transient event. 
The phase space diagrams for Several typical fast transients are demonstrated to show the efficacy of the mathod. 

### 1.2 Code Written

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JMCYywB5v94qaUQn5cbkkPjXci6OqeqQ?usp=sharing: 
Read out the data. Used the data for EB as an example to see what the data look like. Tried to display the details of 'MJD' and 'SNID' to see if there is any patterns, 
but not helpful with my understanding of the data. 

### 1.3 Other (algorithm, discussion with experts, went to conference)

## 2. Figures (at least 1 figure)

No figure generated yet. 

### 3 Results (required)

I got the data to my Google Drive and opened it with Colaboratory. But the meaning of the data is confusing to me. I tried to 
look for documents that can provide more information, but without much results. 

### 4 Planning (required)

Figure out the meaning of the data and make a program for the statistics property of the data.
