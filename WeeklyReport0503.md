Generated the presto-color phase space diagram and updated to work in batch. 


### 1.3 Other (algorithm, discussion with experts, went to conference)



## 2. Figures (at least 1 figure)

Figure 1: The examples of the presto-color space diagrams generated in batch, the top is for SNIax and the bottom is for AGN.

### 3 Results (required)

Made the code for making the presto-color diagrams in batch, provided the name of the event, the range of the file, and the range of objects in each file.

### 4 Planning (required)

Look into scipy fitting and the ways to save the results, try to make the code for realizing the function.
