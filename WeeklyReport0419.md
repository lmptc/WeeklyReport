# Ming Lian - Week of 04/19/2021

## 1. At least 2 of the 3 subsections should have material

### 1.1 Papers Read


### 1.2 Code Written

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CAn-SyK56N7txcbii3NAveFHkk191Zuz?usp=sharing: 

Counted the numbers of objects in each type of events, and the numbers of observations of each objects.


### 1.3 Other (algorithm, discussion with experts, went to conference)
https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.rec.html#structured-datatypes

The code for prosessing SNANA data.


## 2. Figures (at least 1 figure)

![](https://github.com/lmptc/WeeklyReport/blob/master/Images/Num%20of%20Objects%20and%20Num%20of%20Observations.png)

Figure 1: The numbers of objects in each type of events (top panel), and the numbers of observations of each objects (bottom panel). 
The bars in the bottom panel shows the averaged number of observations for one object, the red dots are error bars, which show all the objects 
of the same type have the same number of observations. 

### 3 Results (required)

Counted the numbers of objects in each type of events, and the numbers of observations of each objects. 
Got familared with the structure and operation of the data. 

### 4 Planning (required)

Find out the distribution of the intervals of the observations. Currently, I found there are 2-day and 10-day intervals by manually browsing some part of the data. 
Generate some presto-color diagrams tentatively, with one kind of events, two pairs of filters.
