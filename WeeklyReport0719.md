## 1. Papers and code

### 1.1 Papers Read

[Variable stars: Which Nyquist frequency?](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9808176): 
The paper suggests that that the frequency limit of the signal that can be recovered from a irregular sampling can be much higher than 
a regular sampling (assuming the average sampling rates are the same). It also provide a way to figure out wheather 
a frequency is aliasing or not, and how to reduce the aliasing in the futuring abservations. 


### 1.2 Code Written

[No. of Visits Under Conditions by Seasons](https://github.com/lmptc/MAF/blob/master/No.%20of%20Visits%20Under%20Conditions%20by%20Seasons.ipynb): 
Count the number of visits for WFD by seasons in 2023, with airmass>1.1 and fiveSigmaDepth>2.3.

Figure 1 : The number of visit by seasons for WFD in 2023, when airmass is larger than 1.1 and fiveSigmaDepth is larger than 23. The four figures are
Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, in order.


### 3 Results

Read about signal samplings. Plot the number of visits by seasons. Tried to add the counts of different years, but have not 
come up with a simple way to do that yet.
