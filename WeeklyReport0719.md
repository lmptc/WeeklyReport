## 1. Papers and code

### 1.1 Papers Read

[Variable stars: Which Nyquist frequency?](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9808176): 
The paper suggests that that the frequency limit of the signal that can be recovered from a irregular sampling can be much higher than 
a regular sampling (assuming the average sampling rates are the same). It also provide a way to figure out wheather 
a frequency is aliasing or not, and how to reduce the aliasing in the futuring abservations. 


### 1.2 Code Written

[No. of Visits Under Conditions by Seasons](https://github.com/lmptc/MAF/blob/master/No.%20of%20Visits%20with%20Conditions.ipynb): 
Count the number of visits that satisfy certain conditions. 

## 2. Figures

Figure 1 : The number of visit by seasons for WFD, when airmass is larger than 1.1 and fiveSigmaDepth is larger than 23. The four figures are
Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, in order.


### 3 Results

Writed the first metric that realizes a simple function. Read the codes for metricBundle and metricBundleGroup and figured out 
the broad process of MAF.
